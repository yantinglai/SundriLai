My journey to CS is kind of random. Back in college, I was studying German language and I couldn’t find the meaning out of it. One day, I was shopping at a super market and saw a yellow peach being thrown away simply because it had a black spot. “How many fruits were being wasted simply because they were imperfect?” I thought to myself. Later, the Ugly Fruit startup was born, to turn imperfect food into delicious products like Jam and Chips. I then got to learn about building websites, designing apps, starting my first YouTube channels, and now pursing a CS degree at Northeastern Seattle. All the projects I listed here are things that truly interests me and I believe would have a positive impact on someone’s life. One of my YouTube video “[How to study when you don't feel like it?](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkK055sGHKk)” has got over 22,000 views.
